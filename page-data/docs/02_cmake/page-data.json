For most people, however, getting started with C++ is a big hurdle. Most people think that it is hard to setup a C++ project and write correct/nice code. With the use of CMake and the Eigen and Boost libraries however, developing a C++ project for a scientific computing task will be almost as easy as writing a Python project with NumPy.</p>\n<p>The only thing that is a bit more involved is the initial setup.
